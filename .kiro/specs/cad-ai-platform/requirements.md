# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The CAD AI Platform is a comprehensive web-based system designed to revolutionize how engineering teams manage, search, and interact with CAD files using artificial intelligence. The platform will enable users to upload CAD files, train custom AI models on their datasets, and perform intelligent searches using natural language queries. The system aims to improve productivity by making CAD file discovery more intuitive and efficient while providing powerful AI-driven insights.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an engineer, I want to upload and manage CAD files with version control, so that I can maintain organized access to my design files and their evolution over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a CAD file THEN the system SHALL store the file with metadata including filename, size, upload date, and user information
2. WHEN a user uploads a new version of an existing CAD file THEN the system SHALL maintain version history with change descriptions
3. WHEN a user views a CAD file THEN the system SHALL display a thumbnail preview and basic metadata
4. IF a CAD file upload fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and allow retry
5. WHEN a user searches for files THEN the system SHALL support filtering by tags, project name, part name, and date ranges

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an engineer, I want to search for CAD files using natural language queries, so that I can quickly find relevant designs without remembering exact filenames or locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a natural language search query THEN the system SHALL interpret the query and return relevant CAD files ranked by relevance
2. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL show relevance scores and confidence levels for each result
3. WHEN a user provides feedback on search results THEN the system SHALL store the feedback to improve future searches
4. IF no AI model is available THEN the system SHALL fall back to basic keyword-based search
5. WHEN a user types a partial query THEN the system SHALL provide search suggestions based on previous queries and file metadata

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data scientist or AI engineer, I want to create custom datasets from CAD files and train AI models, so that I can develop specialized search capabilities tailored to my organization's specific CAD content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a dataset THEN the system SHALL allow selection of specific CAD files and assignment of labels
2. WHEN a user initiates model training THEN the system SHALL process the dataset and train a neural network model
3. WHEN model training is in progress THEN the system SHALL display real-time training metrics and progress updates
4. WHEN model training completes THEN the system SHALL evaluate model performance and make it available for search
5. IF model training fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and suggested remediation steps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage user access and system resources, so that I can ensure security, control costs, and maintain system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator creates a user account THEN the system SHALL assign appropriate role-based permissions (admin, engineer, viewer)
2. WHEN a user attempts to access restricted functionality THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based access controls
3. WHEN system resources are under high load THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting and queue management
4. WHEN a user uploads files THEN the system SHALL validate file types, scan for malware, and enforce size limits
5. WHEN administrators view system metrics THEN the system SHALL display user activity, storage usage, and model performance statistics

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an engineer, I want to visualize CAD files directly in the browser, so that I can preview designs without downloading files or using external CAD software.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a CAD file THEN the system SHALL display a 3D preview using WebGL rendering
2. WHEN viewing a CAD file THEN the system SHALL support basic navigation controls (zoom, pan, rotate)
3. WHEN a CAD file contains multiple layers or components THEN the system SHALL allow users to toggle visibility
4. IF a CAD file format is not supported for preview THEN the system SHALL display file metadata and download options
5. WHEN loading large CAD files THEN the system SHALL implement progressive loading to maintain responsive performance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the platform to provide RESTful APIs, so that I can integrate CAD AI capabilities into existing engineering workflows and tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external systems make API requests THEN the system SHALL authenticate requests using JWT tokens
2. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL return consistent JSON responses with proper HTTP status codes
3. WHEN API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses with retry information
4. WHEN API versions change THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility for at least one major version
5. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages with request IDs for troubleshooting

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want the system to maintain audit trails and provide reporting capabilities, so that I can track usage patterns and ensure compliance with organizational policies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users perform actions THEN the system SHALL log all file uploads, searches, and model training activities
2. WHEN administrators request reports THEN the system SHALL generate usage statistics, performance metrics, and user activity summaries
3. WHEN sensitive operations occur THEN the system SHALL maintain detailed audit logs with timestamps and user identification
4. WHEN data retention policies are in effect THEN the system SHALL automatically archive or delete old data according to configured rules
5. WHEN compliance audits are conducted THEN the system SHALL provide exportable reports in standard formats (CSV, PDF)

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an engineer working with sensitive designs, I want the platform to implement robust security measures, so that I can trust the system to protect confidential CAD files and intellectual property.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt all files and database records at rest
2. WHEN data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS/TLS encryption for all communications
3. WHEN users authenticate THEN the system SHALL support multi-factor authentication for administrative accounts
4. WHEN files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL scan for malware and validate file integrity
5. WHEN security incidents are detected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and log security events for investigation
